🎒背包问题\\n\\n今天我们讲背包问题。首先什么是背包问题？背包问题可以描述为：给定N件物品和一个限定最大承受重量背包，每种物品都有自己的重量weight(w)和价格value(v)，如何选择最合适的物品放置于给定的背包中，才能使背包中物品的总重量小于等于背包的最大承受重量，同时使得背包中物品的价值最高。\\n\\nPS：背包问题有很多种，我们今天讲的是0/1背包问题，就是说每种物品只能选择0次或1次。每种物品不能被选择多次也不可以被拆开选择。\\n\\n## 转移方程：\\n```javascript\\nif (itemWeight > knapsackWeight) {\\n  table[row][col] = table[row - 1][col];\\n} else {\\n  table[row][col] = Math.max(\\n    table[row - 1][col], \\n    table[row - 1][knapsackWeight - itemWeight] + itemValue\\n  );\\n}\\n```\\nor\\n```javascript\\nif (item.weight > knapsack.weight) {\\n  table[row][col] = getPreviousValue(row, col);\\n} else {\\n  table[row][col] = Math.max(getPreviousValue(row, col), getUpdatedValue(row, knapsack, item));\\n}\\n\\nconst getPreviousValue = (row, col) => {\\n  return table[row - 1][col];\\n};\\n\\nconst getUpdatedValue = (row, knapsack, itemWeight, itemValue) => {\\n  return table[row - 1][knapsack.weight - item.weight] + item.value;\\n};\\n```\\n\\n然后它的计算原理/转移方程的意思是：\\n- 当物品的重量大于当前背包的最大承受重量的时候，这件物品不能被放入背包中，所以保持copy原先背包中物品的总价值。\\n- else的意思是，当物品的重量小于等于当前背包的最大承受重量时候，我们从下面两个值中选一个较大值更新当前背包中商品的总价值。第一个是指这个物品没有放入背包以前背包中物品的总价值，第二个是指从用当前的物品替换背包中相同重量的物品以后背包中商品的总价值。然后在他们两个中，找一个较大值更新当前背包中物品的总价值。\\n\\n## Go Through an Example:\\n\\n可能公式写的或者我讲的不是很清楚，下面咱们通过一个例子来详细的理解一下怎么计算背包问题。\\n\\n首先我们有4个物品，它们的weight和value分别是：\\n在这个例子里面，我们有4件物品，然后背包的最大承受重量是6。首先我们为了计算方便，添加了两排0，但是它们也有它们的意义：\\n- 竖的一排0是说：当背包的最大承受重量为0时，它不能装任何物品，所以背包中物品的总价值只能为0。\\n- 横的一排0是说：当把一个重量为0，价值也为0的的物品装进背包中，背包的中物品的总价值仍然是0.\\n\\n然后咱们从物品1开始。\\n\\nkeywords:\\n- 背包中原先商品的总价值\\n\"","import * as React from 'react';\nimport {

default \"# 🎒背包问题\\n\\n今天我们讲背包问题。首先什么是背包问题？背包问题可以描述为：给定有N件物品和一个限定最大承受重量背包，每种物品都有自己的重量weight(w)和价格value(v)，如何选择最合适的物品放置于给定的背包中，才能使背包中物品的总价值最高。\\n\\nPS：背包问题有很多种，我们今天讲的是0/1背包问题，就是说每种物品只能选择0次或1次。\\n\\n## 转移方程：\\n```javascript\\nif (itemWeight > currentWeight) {\\n  table[row][col] = table[row - 1][col];\\n} else {\\n  table[row][col] = Math.max(table[row - 1][col], table[row - 1][currentWeight - itemWeight] + itemValue);\\n}\\n```\\n\\n然后它的计算原理/转移方程的意思是：\\n- 当某种物品的重量大于背包的最大承受重量的时候，背包承受不了这件物品的重量，所以不能把这件物品放入背包中，所以保持copy原先背包中物品的总价值。\\n\\n- 反之，当物品的重量小于等于背包的最大承受重量的时候，我们从下面两个值中选一个最大值，第一个是指这个物品没有放入背包以前背包中物品的总价值，第二个是指从背包中减去这个物品重量的对应物品的价值，再加上物品的价值。\\n\\n## Go Through an Example:\\n\\n可能公式写的或者我讲的不是很清楚，下面咱们通过一个例子来更加详细的理解一下怎么计算背包问题。\\n\\n在这个例子里面，我们有4件物品，然后背包的最大承受重量是6。首先我们为了计算方便，添加了两排0，但是它们也有它们的意义：\\n- 竖的一排0是说：当背包的最大承受重量为0时，它不能装任何物品，所以背包中物品的总价值只能为0。\\n- 横的一排0是说：当把一个重量为0，价值也为0的的物品装进背包中，背包的中物品的总价值仍然是0.\\n\\n然后咱们从物品1开始。\\n\"","import * as React from 'react';\nimport { MuiThemeProvider, createMuiTheme } from '@material-ui/core/styles';\nimport primary
